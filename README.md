# Multi-Agent Customer Support Automation System

A comprehensive customer support automation system built with LangChain, Streamlit, and FAISS, featuring three specialized AI agents working in sequence to provide accurate and contextual customer support responses.

## üéØ Project Overview

This project demonstrates advanced AI agent coordination for customer support automation. The system processes customer queries through three specialized agents:

1. **Classification Agent** - Categorizes queries into predefined support categories
2. **Retrieval Agent** - Finds relevant FAQ entries using semantic search
3. **Response Agent** - Generates and validates contextual responses

## üèóÔ∏è Technical Architecture

### Core Components

- **LangChain**: Multi-agent orchestration and workflow management
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web interface for real-time query processing
- **FAISS**: Vector similarity search for efficient FAQ retrieval
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: Free LLM models for classification and response generation
- **Sentence Transformers**: Text embeddings for semantic search
